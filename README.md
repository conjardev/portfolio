# Welcome to my portfolio.

This is a collection of my skills and tells you a little bit about me. I‚Äôve worked hard on this over a few months so I hope you all like it. Feedback / Questions are appreciated and can be left [here](https://www.connorjarrett.com/#contact)

Right now I‚Äôve got the domain [connorjarrett.com](https://connorjarrett.com) registered for a year, but I likely will keep it for longer. Below, I will document the inner workings of the site, my design process, and the short log of updates leading up to it‚Äôs release

# Site workings
## SEO
This is the first website I ever SEO optimized, so I went in completely new, but I think that I‚Äôve done well, but, because right now it was so recently launched, I can‚Äôt tell yet. For my SEO, I set many keywords, most of them were based on the website topic (e.g. ‚ÄúWeb Developer Portfolio‚Äù), but some other ones were variants of my name. I used ********************Lighthouse******************** on ******************************Developer Tools****************************** to help me see what areas I was lacking in, to eventually get an SEO score of ******100.******

## Animations
Most animations worked pretty much the same way, the CSS would be set in an original state, and then a class would be applied (such as ******.active****** or ********.visible********) which would have a different set of rules. The property would be applied with the ********************transition******************** rule so that they would animate smoothly.

## Skills & Tools Section
These sections had ********.json******** files made for them containing all the info, then JavaScript would fill in all the info, this was so I could easily change/add anything. This was inspired by [iuri.is](https://iuri.is/).

## Contact Form
I tried something new for the contact form on this site, I used a service called [getform.io](https://getform.io/) to act as a man in the middle for my contact form. When you fill out the form on my site, it sends you to [getform.io](https://getform.io/), who then forwards that on to me. This is because I did not want to put my email address on the site right now.

# Design Process
## Inspiration
I took lots of inspiration from [this article](https://webflow.com/blog/web-developer-portfolio-examples) from Webflow that gave me lots of other people‚Äôs portfolios to look at, one in particular was [edgardeiner.com](https://www.edgardeiner.com/), which my site has some obvious design inspirations from.

I also got a few inspirations from [iuri.is](https://iuri.is/) on how the site would work (such as the json file idea from earlier)

## Older Variants
This design concept was my 3rd iteration. One of those iterations was very similar to [edgardeiner.com](https://www.edgardeiner.com/), to the point where I eventually decided to remake it. Other variants took lots of inspiration from examples I found on Google images.

# Development Update Log
**üÜï 26/12/2022 - Added "work" tab**

**üö© 6/11/2022 - Initial Launch**

**üöß Construction Update 5/11/2022 ~8pm GMT**

I believe that the website is now finished. I think I will take the next couple of days to fully UX check it and see if anything needs adding. I also might get some friends / family to look at it first to see if there‚Äôs anything they would add, a second opinion always helps. 

**üöß Construction Update 5/11/2022** 

Work on the website is going smoothly and lots of the content is now filled in. I think it will be ready for release sometime soon.

**üö©Work begins September 2022**

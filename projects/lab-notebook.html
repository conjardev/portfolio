            <h2>2023</h2>
            
            <p>
                Lab Notebook was a blog I created in 2023 to practice writing regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the 5 months I wrote regularly for Lab Notebook, I covered many things from programming, to privacy, and even movie reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created my own analytics backend to track all the clicks coming into Lab Notebook so I could discover the audiences consuming my content, to target the next piece better.
                I also tracked platforms so I could most effectivley build my audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lab Notebook was built with only static HTML and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub pages for cost reasons. The static element made it a challenge to host a blog effectivley, but I created
                a custom templating system using Markdown files and a NodeJS script.

            <h1>Writing & Video Production via YouTube</h1>
            <h2>December 2023 - November 2024</h2>
            
            <p>
                In December of 2023, I began writing and planning a video documentary on one of my favourite video games Watch_Dogs 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the year that I worked on the project, I learned lots about writing, audio recording, and video prodction. I also had to create a sucessful marketing strategy to ensure
                that the video could find an audience - this included working with other creators, and members of the games cast.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the video, I also conducted an interview with Shawn Baichoo, one of the actors from the game. For this I had to originally find then communicate professionally with his agent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video released on November 15th 2024, the 8 year anniversary of Watch_Dogs 2's release.
            </p>
